What is the MERN stack?,"MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, used together to build full-stack web applications.",9,High,"Perfect answer! Clear and concise."
What is the MERN stack?,"Umm... it's like, MongoDB and React... and something with Node?",4,Low,"Partial answer. Missing Express.js and unclear structure."
What is the MERN stack?,"I don't know.",1,None,"No attempt. Suggest reviewing MERN fundamentals."
How does MongoDB differ from traditional relational databases?,"MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, unlike relational databases which use structured tables.",8,High,"Accurate comparison. Could add scalability examples."
How does MongoDB differ from traditional relational databases?,"Hmm... MongoDB doesn't use tables? It's more... flexible?",5,Medium,"Correct direction but lacks depth. Mention 'documents vs tables' explicitly."
How does MongoDB differ from traditional relational databases?,"*Fumbling* Tables... SQL... I'm not sure.",2,Low,"Confused. Clarify: MongoDB is document-based, not table-based."
What is JSX in React?,"JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows writing HTML in React and makes syntax readable.",8,Medium,"Good definition. Add example: `<div>{variable}</div>`."
What is JSX in React?,"Umm, HTML inside JavaScript? But it's not really HTML...",6,Medium,"Close. Specify it's JSX (syntax extension) and requires transpilation."
What is JSX in React?,"*Pauses* I forget... is it like a template language?",3,Low,"Incorrect. JSX is JavaScript + HTML, not a template language."
How does the virtual DOM work in React?,"React uses a virtual DOM to track changes and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, improving performance.",9,High,"Excellent! Mentioned diffing algorithm and efficiency."
How does the virtual DOM work in React?,"It's like a copy of the DOM... and React compares things?",6,Medium,"Partial. Add: 'Virtual DOM is lightweight; real DOM updates are batched.'"
How does the virtual DOM work in React?,"I don't understand how it helps.",2,Low,"Review virtual DOM's role in minimizing direct DOM manipulation."
What is middleware in Express.js?,"Middleware functions execute during a request's lifecycle and can modify request/response objects.",8,High,"Clear. Examples: `app.use()`, logging middleware."
What is middleware in Express.js?,"Hmm... functions that run in the middle... like for auth?",5,Medium,"Correct but vague. Specify: 'Order matters; next() passes control.'"
What is middleware in Express.js?,"*Silence* I'm not sure what it does.",1,None,"Key concept! Middleware handles requests (e.g., parsing JSON)."
How can you secure a Node.js application?,"Use environment variables, input validation, JWT for auth, and HTTPS.",8,High,"Comprehensive. Add: 'Helmet.js for headers, rate limiting.'"
How can you secure a Node.js application?,"Umm... passwords? And... HTTPS?",4,Low,"Too generic. Mention specific tools (bcrypt, CORS)."
How can you secure a Node.js application?,"I don’t know where to start.",1,None,"Priority: Start with env vars and input sanitization."
Explain the role of useEffect in React.,"useEffect handles side effects like data fetching or subscriptions in functional components.",9,High,"Perfect. Add: 'Dependency array controls execution.'"
Explain the role of useEffect in React.,"It’s for... hmm... doing stuff after render?",5,Medium,"Close. Specify: 'Replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.'"
Explain the role of useEffect in React.,"*Confused* Is it for state?",2,Low,"No, useState is for state. useEffect is for side effects."
What is supervised learning in Machine Learning?,"Supervised learning trains models on labeled data for predictions/classification.",8,Medium,"Good. Examples: 'Spam detection,房价 prediction.'"
What is supervised learning in Machine Learning?,"Umm... you give it data with answers?",5,Medium,"Yes! 'Labeled data' means input-output pairs (e.g., images + labels)."
What is supervised learning in Machine Learning?,"*Fumbling* Is it like... unsupervised but different?",2,Low,"Opposite. Supervised uses labels; unsupervised finds patterns without labels."
